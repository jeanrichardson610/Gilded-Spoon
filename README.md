🚀 How to Run Locally

Clone this repo

Make sure your images and paths are correct, match folder casing

Use a local server (Live Server, http-server, or similar) — especially for video playback and to avoid issues with file:// paths

Open the site in a browser — it should behave much like what you see on the live version

📌 Deployment Notes

Double-check file/folder names for correct casing.

Be sure static assets (images, video) are in the publicly served folder (for frameworks, often named public or static).

Redeploy to clear cached or outdated assets after changes.

🎯 Future Enhancements

Add backend integration for actual reservations

Add a gallery or events section

Improve accessibility (aria labels, keyboard navigation)

Add light/dark mode toggle

Animate transitions between sections or pages
